# transparent-png
handy function for converting high-res whiteboard sketches to crisp, transparent background PNGs. Thanks for the wicked-awesome Marciana drawing, Monica ;) 

## Getting running
Super easy: 
* clone this repo
* `cd transparent-png`
* `pip install -r requirements.txt`
* To test: `python converter.py`

You should go from this...

to this:

You can point the converter at any file and manually specify the output file: `python converter.py --in_file /tmp/myjpeg.jpg --out_file mypng.png` 

## Tuning the conversion
I use a sigmoid function the looks at how dark a pixel is and, based on that, assigns it an alpha transparency. The sigmoid function is nice because it renders a smooth gradient against a transparent background, avoiding the awkward discontinuities that a simple threshold would create. The defaults I picked worked pretty well, but if you'd like to play with them this is the function you'll be adjusting:

`--offset` shifts the curve right and left, and `--steepness` controls the steepness of the transparency gradient. The larger this number, the closer your approximation to a strict threshold for transparency will be.
